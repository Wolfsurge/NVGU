# NVGU
Utility (mostly for me) for NanoVG. Essentially wraps NanoVG functions to create shapes etc.
Also tries to make it easier for gradients and other stuff.

Any method in the `NVGU` class that accepts a `java.awt.Color` can also accept `NVGUColour` (which extends off of `java.awt.Color`)
which can be used to contain gradients.
